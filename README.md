### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Carlo Schneider and I'm a Software Developer with over 10 years of experience in Front-end development using Typescript, React.js, and Vue.js. I possess a deep understanding of UI technologies, tools, and architecture. In addition 2+ years of experience working at the Back-end using Node.js (Express, TypeGraphQL) with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis. And I have ensured the quality of my code through unit tests using testing frameworks such as Jest and React Testing Library.

Experience working in an agile environment and cross-functional team. I've worked on many different projects like e-commerce stores, CRM systems, and institutional websites.
